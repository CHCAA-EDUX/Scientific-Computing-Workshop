# Some useful links to follow up

These are just some links which go into a bit more detail about the things we’ve been looking at the past few days, along with resources which address the most common questions.

**I want to learn more python**:
That is great. There is mulitple good resources out there:

- Datacamp: https://www.datacamp.com/
- I also recommend this course (Sadly the video are in Danish, but the rest of the material is English)
  - https://cs.au.dk/~gerth/ipsa23/plan-full.html
- A lot of this workshop is also modelled after the software carpentry courses. You can see the full list of lessons here:
  - https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/

**UCloud official user guide and documentation**
- *If you have problems setting something up or want to get more info, check the docs first.*
[Link](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/)

**How do I get a handle of Python basics?**
- *Check out this free online book which contains a whole bunch of really nice, practical exercises (with solutions!)*
[Link](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
- *A slightly more advanced intro which focuses more on using numpy and matplotlib, finally ending with Python scripting. (Our workshops borrowed material from this course, and radically compressed it).*

**The basic Python “data science” stack**
- *Links to documentation for the main Python data science tools that we’ve been working with in this workshop. Get used to them!*
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
[numpy](https://numpy.org/)
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
[scipy](https://scipy.org/)
- *One more that we didn’t look at is scikit-learn which features core machine learning algorithms. We’ll come back to this another day.*
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

**A visual intro to numpy arrays**
- *Great intro to how arrays work, with fantastic visuals that make it all a bit clearer. (For the record, we’ll be seeing more of Jay Alammar’s visualisations later in the semester during NLP!)*
[Link](https://jalammar.github.io/visual-numpy/)

**Why write .py scripts rather than just use Notebooks?** 
- *A blog post on Medium where the author discusses some of the benefits (open in private/incognito if you get a paywall)*
[Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-reasons-why-you-should-switch-from-jupyter-notebook-to-scripts-cb3535ba9c95)
- *A comment thread on the subreddit r/MachineLearning with different perspectives*
[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/be72vd/d_notebooks_versus_scripts_whats_your_workflow/)

**What does if __name__ == "__main__" actually do? Why do we need it?**
- *A really nice discussion of this on StackOverflow; the top answer is one of the best explanations I’ve come across*
