# Formulas and Linear algebra

![python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-%3E=3.7-blue)


When using programming for scientific computing it is important to be able to translate
between mathematical notation and programming. This is what this segment will teach.

This segment uses `numpy`, but can also be done using other array libraries such as
PyTorch, with minor changes.

## Folder structure:
