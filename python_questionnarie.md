# Python Questionnarie

This a intended as a blackboard quiz where people raise their hands if the understand a certain concept. It is not intended to be a test of your knowledge. If you do not understand a concept, that is fine. We will go through it in the workshop.

- `set`

## Control Flow

Do you know what the following control flow statements do?

- `if`
- `elif`
- `else`
- `for`
- `while`
- `break`
- `continue`
- `pass`
- `try`
- `except`

## Functions

Do you know what the following statements do?

- `def`
- `return`
- `lambda`
- `map`
- `filter`
- `zip`

## Object-Oriented Programming

Do you know what the following statements do?

- `__init__`
- `__repr__`
- `__str__`
- `__call__`
- `__add__`
- `__sub__`
- `__mul__`
- `__div__`

## Scripting

Do you know what the following statements do?

- `import`
- `if __name__ == "__main__":`
  
Are you confident in using the following tools?

- `argparse`
- `pathlib`
- `logging`
- `sys`
- `os`

Are you confident calling scripts from the command line? Such as:

```bash
python my_script.py --input_file data.csv --output_file results.csv
```

Could you write a script that you could call from the command line?


## Data Science

Are you confident in using the following tools?

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`


## Debugging

Have you used a debugger before?

## Mathematical Computing

Could you read the formula:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{11} i + 4
$$

Are you comfortable with matrix notation?

$$
A \cdot x = y
$$

Where $A$ is a matrix, $x$ is a vector and $y$ is a vector.

Could you implement them in Python?
