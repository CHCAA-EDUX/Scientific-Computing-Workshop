# Scientific Computing with Python Workshop
This repository contains all of the code and data related to the Fall 2021 (F21) Python workshop for _Cognitive Science_ at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), [Faculty of Arts](https://arts.au.dk/en/). The workshop is taught by [Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus](https://chcaa.io/#/), any inquiries can be addressed to [CHCAA](mailto:chcaa@cas.au.dk?subject=[PftHe21]%20Student%20Inquiry). The workshop is a 3-day on scientific computing with Python. It assumes previous experience with programming and going through object-oriented programming, Numpy and fundamental linear algebra and, lastly, implementing a simple neural network.

This repository is in active development.
